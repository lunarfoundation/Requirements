## Delivery & Formats

Requirements are often delivered to this repository as PDF files. The cadence of Requirements publishing shall be set forth by the Lunar Foundation. We reserve the right to change or re-upload Requirements at any time for any reason. 

## Rules of the Road
We have plenty of experience managing OSS projects, and we're aware how blunt and opinionated developers like ourselves can be. So in order for us to keep everyone in the loop in a transparent way, we need some ground rules to keep the team focused on delivering all the features you’re drooling over.

- Don't open issues here. This is not for bug reports, if you open them here you will be banned from the Lunar repo.
- The list is not necessarily linear. While we strive to make it easy to understand how we want to work, we will likely complete tasks out of order.
- We will not change the status of items in progress. Doing that would take too much time to keep the lists synchronized with our internal systems. As tasks are completed, we will check them off.
- No assumptions allowed. What we’re communicating is a high-level overview. 
  - You should NOT assume what you see is the extent of what we’re tracking or doing. That is by design. A lot more work has been done then you will ever be aware of.
  - You should NOT assume the next item on the list is what we’re working on next. We’re working based on the order of our internal tracking systems.
